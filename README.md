Hobb API Server: backend for the Rebus Reader system

## Commit Message Style

`prefix: message`

Where prefix can be any of: build, ci, chore, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test.

The other rules are as [described here](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional)

## JS style

Code should be written in the [Standard]() style and even if it isn't, `prettier-standard` is run on commit to convert the code into Standard style.

(I don't particularly prefer Standard style over any other variety, but we need a coding style and that one's as good as any other and comes with a bunch of ready-made tools.)
